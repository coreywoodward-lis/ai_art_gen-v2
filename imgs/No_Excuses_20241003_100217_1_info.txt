Seed Idea: 1. A picture of a stupefied individual with goggles on, seemingly in mid-dance with vibrant, energetic colors emanating from behind.
Prompt: A stupefied individual takes centre stage, goggles perched on their forehead and body frozen in an energetic mid-dance. Their vivacious movements seem almost tangible against a backdrop of vibrant, dynamic colours, swirling and pulsing in sync with their rhythm. Captured in this kinetic moment, they embody the uncontained energy and momentum of Nottingham hip hop.
