Seed Idea: 3. A shadowy silhouette caught mid-movement in a dynamic street dance pose, with a bright light shining from the spine area.
Prompt: A shadowy figure is captured in the midst of an intense street dance move, their pose radiating raw energy. A startlingly bright light, reminiscent of a spotlight or flare, illuminates from the silhouette's spine area, creating an aura of power around the dancer. This figure is set against a backdrop of gritty urban architecture, punctuated by graffiti, dim street lamps, and the moody dark of the night.
