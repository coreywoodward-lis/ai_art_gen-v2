Seed Idea: 2. A silhouette of a DJ mixing on his deck against the backdrop of a crowd, bringing to life the drum 'n' bass influences of the track.
Prompt: A DJ's silhouette stands at the forefront, one hand adjusting a dial on his deck, the other raised high, engaging the audience. The background pulses with the shadowy outlines of an energetic crowd, their hands in the air, reflecting the lively mood of the album. This scene is presented in a monochromatic style, emphasizing the bassline and Nottingham hip hop influences.
