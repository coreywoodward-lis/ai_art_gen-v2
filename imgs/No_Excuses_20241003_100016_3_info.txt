Seed Idea: 3. A figure sprinting along the edge of a cliff overlooking an ocean, with an impending wave about to crash, metaphorically visualizing the strong wave and seasick references in the lyrics.
Prompt: A single figure in mid-run adorns the cover, dangerously close to the edge of a jagged cliff against a backdrop of the passionate ocean, under a gloomy sky. The depiction of a monstrous wave, standing hundreds of feet tall, is about to crash onto the cliff, showing an intense and energetic vibe. The style is raw and animated, with elements of street art and graffiti to match the nottingham hip hop and bassline genre.
