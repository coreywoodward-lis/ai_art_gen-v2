Seed Idea: 2. An outline of a person's silhouette, within which is an image of unleashed swirling waves, symbolizing strong, uncontainable feelings.
Prompt: A person's silhouette is filled with violently swirling waves in shades of blues, capturing the person's uncontainable feelings. The rest of the cover is left in minimalistic style, bringing focus to the waves within the silhouette. This visual representation creates a stark and contemplative mood, complementing the indie, post-teen, afrofuturist style of the music.
