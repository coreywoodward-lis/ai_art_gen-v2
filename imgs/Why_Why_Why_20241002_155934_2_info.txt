Seed Idea: 2. A drawn image of a bedroom scene at night, with a rumpled, empty bed and an open window letting in moonlight.
Prompt: A sketched illustration adorns the cover, detailing an intimate nocturnal setting. A tousled bed is in the center of the room, its emptiness emphasized by the illumination of the moonlight pouring in through an open window. This serene and largely monochrome scene is subtly broken by faint streaks of silver to mirror the moon's glow.
