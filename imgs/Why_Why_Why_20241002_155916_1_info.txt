Seed Idea: 1. A leather-bound journal laying open with half-erased pencil scribbles and a tear-soaked page.
Prompt: An aged, leather-bound journal lays open on a wooden surface. Defaced by half-erased pencil scrawls, the pages appear worn whereas the opposite part of the spread harbours a few moisture-stained tear marks, indicating emotional distress. The lighting casts a muted yet melancholy glow that heightens the texture of the paper and the worn leather.
