Seed Idea: 3. A monochrome art of a DJ console mixing and blending, while a faint mirror image of a crowd dancing is reflected on the surface.
Prompt: A monochrome depiction of a DJ console comes into focus, with distinct buttons, controls, and a hand on one of the turntables. On the console's polished surface, a subtle, almost ethereal reflection of a dancing crowd materializes, like a ghostly specter of the energy they emit. The art employs stark contrast and shadow to convey a sense of both the DJ's authority over the sound and the kinetic, near-frantic energy of the dancing crowd.
